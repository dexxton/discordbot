# discordbot
This Discord bot is a work in progress
Leaving my code open as I am just a beginner to python and am using this for a learning experience.

You will need to Edit 2 fields in the code to get this bot to work proper
1) Chat ID of the welcome page
2) bot run Token at the bottom of the code
